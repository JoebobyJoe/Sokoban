# Sokoban
The best puzzle game ever

Sokoban is a 2D puzzle game where the user has to push objects (in this case targets but creates/boxes are also common) onto highlighted destination tiles. Each destination tile can only hold one target and so the user has to move all the targets to the destination in order to complete the level. The player can only push so once an object is against a wall it cannot be moved away from the wall.
